wearing a blue
I have never seen before
Sangre de Cristos

canyon sunset . . .
so much of his story
I never knew

thunderstorm—
the shapes of birds
among the swaying leaves

night of stars—
old wooden crosses lean
into the land

rubbing oil
into the baseball glove
birthday snow

pink hoodoos
only my left arm
sunburned

white hiking socks
a little less
Red Rock country

new table
the years it took
to grow the trees

sea breeze
the salt taste
in her kiss

waking from a dream
without a center
misty crescent moon

en mar azul
como ballenas muertas
dos rocas negras

on the blue sea
like dead whales
two black rocks

shorter days
the leaves and my hair
change color

rocking lightly
in a slight breeze
cicada shell

global warming . . .
a stamp from Mars
on the envelope

terracotta moon
the door propped open
with a broom

Moving . . .
I take my seashell collection
back to the beach

dust bathing
a jackrabbit
kind of day

morning coffee
the roses and i
find some common ground

before my time
a thunder egg
split in two

sharing spicy tamales
our conversation
perks up

penny for your thoughts
he says . . . she says
way too much

Down in the canyon
the yellow light of a hogan—
threat of male rain

firefly!
hitching a ride
on its own light

snow
on the blue hills
day moon

too late braking the hitchhiker’s middle finger

Ghost Ranch
no need
for a dreamcatcher

flyover country—
the speck of a tractor
plowing dusk

vintage ring its life before us

trickster wind
a beach ball
travels down the coast

alive as it’s ever been
earthworm in the robin’s bill

worn smooth by wind
layers of light seep
into a cavern

waxed apples
am told I have
my mother’s smile

woods walk—
I catch the cobwebs
that miss my son

holding the sunset
the red clay
of the infield

deleting her
last text
scent of snow

firehouse fish fry—
from the makeshift stage
the banjo’s heat

the park road
would take longer . . .
month of leaves

my inner Chiyo-ni
walking the red path
to Chimayó

mammatus clouds
the cries of hawks
build above me

mountain’s outline
the difference walking
alone

tule elk . . .
recalculating
the way home

hummingbird—
talk of building
a wall

Tōhoku’s spring—
here and there
the butterbur buds

alluvium
I pocket a stone
meant for the sea

Similkameen
the river rolls
off my tongue
