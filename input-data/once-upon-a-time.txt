All excuses spent,
I tell my wife
about my alien abduction.

rooftop restaurant
a crow drinks up clouds
from an empty table

anniversary
the entomologist buys the roses
with aphids

cherry blossoms
she tries on her first
wedding ring

slow dancing
I pretend
I remember

I think I’ll build a hut
right here
with these words

f(ailing)s

going rogue
I count
my syllables

dust of an uncertain world
brushed away
by the autumn wind

taps . . .
all we could say
now said

sound of a stream
in the wind
poplar leaves

tall window
of a ruined church—
the glory of lichens

rivergum walk
magpies warble
at morning recess

the vast west
railroad cars decouple
in the dark

sleepless
a summer night
dabbling in rain

a nun’s collection
of nesting glass hens
late-autumn sun

temple redone
Kali’s tongue
not so red

Hiroshima Day
shakuhachi cracks
at every node

Valentine’s Day
park pigeons settle on
LO
VE

the one I love
sitting out back
with the feral cats

polished wood shelf
the book collection
doubled

crunching
spring cabbages
hippopotamus

depression
each snowflake
apparently different

positive . . .
magnolia buds
browned by frost

abandoned quarry
standing at the bottom
an inukshuk

autumn dusk
the Van Gogh
in the sunflowers

first frost
a retelling
of the fable

pumpkin weigh-in . . .
the judge’s motion
to lift off hands

big shot
three olives
in his martini

trail map
you are here
and now

supermoon—
they abandon
their selfie sticks

iced tea with lemon
an undeclared contest
for best grandmother

a coyote disappears
down the deer track
burst milkweed pods

mother’s pastry brush—
stiff bristles bending
more each year

morning walk
how the gulls have grown
to ignore me

winter’s bone the smell of sushi

kayak conversation
the blue heron
hears enough

autumn arrives
cool breeze stretches
the harbor’s mooring lines

at the top
of the ferris wheel
mary jane

home early
I explain my lay-off
to the dog

shoes off, coat in tray
belt removed, pockets emptied
I feel so secure

conch to my ear sonic boom

tangled lives—
i square the placemat
with the table

Year of the Sheep—
another month
wanders off

late apology—
the parted beak
of a carved bird

mall Santa—
when I sit on his lap
he ho ho ho’s

old poet’s reading
each book dedicated
to a new woman

once upon a time
on grandma’s porch
the world

morning meditation
hummingbird visits
the prayer flags
