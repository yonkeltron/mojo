late spring
the emptiness inside
a cracked blue egg

tending gumbo the blend of our voices

New Year's Day
a toddler's shovelful
of snow

yellowjacket
in the bottle's throat
summers end

slow-falling snow
the steady hand
of the beggar

Sandia mountain
there's no word in Tiwa
for "whale"

making tamales
the flow
of family stories

bedtime
wind and streetlight
play tag in our tree

progressive church
in the collection plate
a lottery ticket

Crystal Simone Smith
Durham, North Carolina

church bells
at dusk—I swing
at the last pitch

the White House
whiter than ever
November chill

winding up
the pitcher launches
summer thunder

The dog's gray muzzle
rests in my hands
still holding the ball

early daffodils
deep in an unkempt forest—
her curls upon curls

full
moon
tango
on
water

safe house
in the back yard
a sleeping doe

snow-dome
quietly
steadily
I too settle

taut tent
the tympani
of rain

Superbowl party
I make new friends
with the dog

one fortune cookie
for the two of us to share
crescent moon

a hawk takes off
after a while
I touch down

Durban bus stop
I stoop to fill my hands
with frangipani

first snow
a teacher joins her class
at the window

night breeze
I listen to jazz
in my car

molting swallow
she tells me
about her rapist

ants crawl
across our unfolded map—
highway rest stop

the weight
of a paper crane
first snow

dark night
playing the harp by touch
power outage

end of the year—
the swing's muddy underside
reflected in a puddle+

deep autumn
her left side sagging I visit
the right side

shop owner
dishes out gelato
and gossip

fading photo
a moment of our youth
sitting in the sun

over the wall
without papers
migrating geese

a new lift to the door—
Grandma,
cherry blossoms are waiting!

home
from the mammogram
fresh squeezed orange juice
new diagnosis
learning to live with
the way she says it

rainy day—
I can't see the bright side
of anything

cloud shapes . . .
my sister and her wife
discuss baby names

wishing
she wasn't cremated
Mother's Day

family graves
all tombstones except grandpa's
lean to the right
